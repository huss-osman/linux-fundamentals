# Writing Your First Script

## Overview
A Bash script is a plain text file containing a sequence of commands executed in order.

Scripts allow tasks to be automated consistently and repeatably.

---

## Key Concepts

- Scripts execute top to bottom
  
- Commands behave the same as in the terminal
  
- Scripts must be executable to run directly

---

## Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Bash scripts are plain text

- Execution order matters

- Scripts reduce manual repetition

---

## Reflection
Writing a first script made Bash feel practical rather than abstract.
