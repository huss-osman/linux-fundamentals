# Bash Fundamentals

This folder contains my core **Bash fundamentals** notes as part of my DevOps training.

Each topic focuses on understanding **how Bash works**, not just memorising syntax or commands.  
Examples are practical, script-focused, and tied to real-world automation and DevOps usage.

---

## Topics Covered

- [Introduction to Bash](./introduction.md)  
  What Bash is, how it fits into Linux, and why it matters for automation.

- [Writing Your First Script](./writing-first-script.md)  
  Script structure, execution order, and basic automation patterns.

- [The Shebang Line](./shebang.md)  
  How Linux selects interpreters and why the shebang matters.

- [Comments](./comments.md)  
  Documenting intent and improving script readability.

- [Running Scripts](./running-scripts.md)  
  Executable permissions, PATH, and running scripts from anywhere.

- [Variables](./variables.md)  
  Assignment, expansion, quoting, and common pitfalls.

- [Script Parameters](./parameters.md)  
  Positional arguments, argument handling, and validation.

- [Arithmetic Expansion](./arithmetic-expansion.md)  
  Performing calculations safely in Bash.

- [Conditionals](./conditionals.md)  
  Decision-making using exit codes and test expressions.

- [Loops](./loops.md)  
  Repeating operations with `for` and `while` loops.

- [Functions](./functions.md)  
  Structuring scripts and reducing duplication.

- [User Input](./user-input.md)  
  Reading and validating user input.

- [Piping and Redirection](./piping-and-redirection.md)  
  `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, pipes, and data flow.

- [Exit Codes](./exit-codes.md)  
  Signalling success and failure in scripts and pipelines.

- [Shell Options (`set`)](./set-options.md)  
  Writing safer scripts with strict execution modes.

- [Environment Variables & PATH](./environment-and-path.md)  
  Environment inheritance and command discovery.

- [Working with Files](./working-with-files.md)  
  File checks, safe reads/writes, and defensive scripting.

## Learning Focus

- Learn why Bash behaves the way it does, not just how to write scripts
- Use Bash the way it is used in production environments
- Understand failure modes and defensive scripting patterns
- Build a strong foundation for CI/CD pipelines, Dockerfiles, and cloud automation

These notes are actively updated as I progress through my DevOps curriculum.
