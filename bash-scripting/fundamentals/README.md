This folder contains my core **Bash fundamentals** notes as part of my DevOps training.

Each topic focuses on understanding **how Bash works**, not just memorising syntax or commands.

Examples are practical, script-focused, and tied to real-world automation and DevOps usage.

## Topics Covered

- [Introduction to Bash](./01-introduction.md)  
  What Bash is, how it fits into Linux, and why it matters for automation.

  Script structure, execution order, and basic automation patterns.

- [The Shebang Line](./03-shebang.md)  
  How Linux selects interpreters and why the shebang matters.

- [Comments](./04-comments.md)  
  Documenting intent and improving script readability.

- [Running Scripts](./05-running-scripts.md)

## Learning Focus

- Learn why Bash behaves the way it does, not just how to write scripts
- Use Bash the way it is used in production environments
- Understand failure modes and defensive scripting patterns
- Build a strong foundation for CI/CD pipelines, Dockerfiles, and cloud automation

These notes are actively updated as I progress through my DevOps curriculum.
