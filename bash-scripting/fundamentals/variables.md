# Variables

## Overview
Variables store values for reuse within a script.

---

## Key Concepts

- No spaces around `=`
  
- Variables are untyped
  
- Expansion uses `$`

---

## Examples

```bash
name="Alice"
age=30
echo "$name"
```

## Key Takeaways

- Variables reduce duplication

- Quoting prevents bugs

- Bash treats values as strings by default

## Reflection
Variables made scripts easier to extend without rewriting logic.
