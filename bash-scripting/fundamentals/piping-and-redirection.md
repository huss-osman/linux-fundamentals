# Piping and Redirection

## Overview
Pipes and redirection control data flow between commands.

---

## Key Concepts

- stdout feeds stdin
  
- stderr is separate
  
- Commands are composable

---

## Examples

```bash
ls | grep txt
command > output.txt
```

## Key Takeaways

- Linux tools are composable

- Data flow is explicit

- Pipes enable powerful workflows

## Reflection
Pipes made Linux feel like a toolkit rather than isolated commands.
