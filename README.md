# DevOps Learning

Hands-on learning focused on building strong foundations in Linux and Bash for DevOps.

This repository documents my progress through:

- Linux fundamentals (filesystem, permissions, processes, text processing)
  
- Bash scripting fundamentals and automation basics
  
- Practical reinforcement through Bandit and SadServers

The emphasis is on understanding system behaviour through hands-on practice and clear documentation.

🚧 Work in progress — continuously updated as I progress.
