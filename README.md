# Linux Fundamentals

This repository documents my hands-on learning of Linux fundamentals as part of my DevOps training.

The focus is on understanding **how Linux works**, not memorising commands — covering filesystem behaviour, permissions, process management, redirection, and troubleshooting through real-world challenges.

## Topics Covered
- Linux terminal basics
- File system & navigation
- Permissions and ownership
- Users, groups, and sudo
- Environment variables
- Input/output redirection & pipes
- Bash vs Zsh
- Vim basics
- OverTheWire Bandit wargame
- SadServers troubleshooting exercises

## Learning Approach
- Hands-on practice in real Linux environments
- Solving problems before looking up solutions
- Documenting *why* commands work, not just what they do
- Revisiting concepts through Bandit and SadServers

## Directory Overview
- `fundamentals/` → Core Linux concepts and notes
- `bandit/` → Bandit wargame solutions and explanations
- `sadservers/` → Real-world Linux troubleshooting

## Notes
This repository reflects learning progress and reasoning.  
Solutions are documented to demonstrate understanding, not copy-paste answers.

Linux is the foundation of DevOps — everything that follows builds on this.
