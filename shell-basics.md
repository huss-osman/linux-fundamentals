# Shell Basics

## Overview
A shell is a program that interprets user commands and communicates with the operating system. It acts as the interface between the user and the system kernel.

Understanding how shells work helps improve efficiency when working extensively in the terminal.

## Key Concepts

### What a Shell Is
The shell reads commands entered by the user and executes them by interacting with the operating system.

### Bash vs ZSH
- **Bash** is the default shell on many Linux systems and is widely supported.
- **ZSH** offers additional features such as improved auto-completion and plugin support.

### Aliases
Aliases allow users to create shortcuts for frequently used commands, reducing repetitive typing.

### Plugins
Shell plugins enhance productivity by adding features like syntax highlighting, command suggestions, and improved navigation.

## Commands Practised

### `alias`
Creates shortcuts for longer or frequently used commands.

### `source`
Reloads shell configuration files without restarting the terminal.

## Reflection
Customising the shell made the terminal feel more efficient and approachable. Small improvements like aliases and plugins can significantly improve daily workflows.
