This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Linux** as part of my **DevOps training with CoderCo**.

Linux is the foundation of modern infrastructure. Nearly everything in DevOps — containers, CI/CD, cloud platforms, and automation — assumes a strong understanding of Linux at the command line. This repository exists to build and demonstrate that foundation.

The focus throughout this work is on **understanding how Linux works**, not memorising commands.

## 🧠 New to Linux? Read This First

- Don’t panic when the terminal looks empty, or when the output looks confusing. That’s normal.
- Use `man`, `--help`, or Google to understand commands and how to use them — you don’t need to memorise everything.
- Get comfortable with the basics: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `find`, `file`, and `grep`.
- Remember to make a note of each password.
- Make notes on commands as you go.
- If you're on Windows, consider installing Linux through WSL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you start, I highly recommend watching this guide to mastering Linux man pages.  
> It will be invaluable throughout the challenge and make you less dependent on Google and AI.

## 🛠️ How to Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
- Click the Start menu, search for **Windows PowerShell**, then right-click and choose **Run as Administrator**.

### 2. Run the install command
```powershell
wsl --install
```
- This will install WSL along with Ubuntu by default. You may be prompted to restart your computer.

### 3. Set up your Linux user
- After restarting, Ubuntu will launch automatically and ask you to create a username and password.

You’re now ready to start using Linux on Windows!

## Learning Objectives

By working through this module, I aimed to:

- Confidently navigate the Linux file system via the command line
- Manage files, directories, and permissions
- Understand users, groups, and sudo privileges
- Work with processes and system monitoring tools
- Use core Linux utilities (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, pipes, redirection)
- Understand stdin, stdout, and stderr data flow
- Apply fundamentals through structured challenges and troubleshooting

---

  Searching, filtering, and transforming text using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and pipelines.

- [Redirection and Pipes](./fundamentals/data-redirection.md)  
  `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, pipes, and chaining commands.

- [Process Management](./fundamentals/process-management.md)  
  Inspecting running processes, background jobs, monitoring system activity, and safely stopping processes.

## Learning Approach

This repository reflects **how I learn**, not just what I learned.

- Hands-on practice in real Linux environments (WSL, VMs, cloud instances)
- Solving problems before looking up solutions
- Documenting **why commands work**, not just what they do
- Revisiting concepts through Bandit and SadServers
- Treating confusion and mistakes as part of the learning process

The goal is long-term understanding that transfers to production systems.

## Fundamentals

The Fundamentals section focuses on building a strong understanding of Linux through hands-on command-line usage and core system concepts.

Rather than memorising commands, the emphasis is on learning how Linux behaves and why.

Each topic covers:

• Core Linux concepts and system behaviour  
• Common commands and how they interact with the system  
• Practical examples based on real-world usage  
• Key takeaways that reinforce long-term understanding  

These notes help build a solid foundation for Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud platforms.

➡️ [View Fundamentals](./fundamentals)

## Labs

The Labs section focuses on reinforcing Linux fundamentals through structured, hands-on problem solving and real-world simulation.

Rather than following guided notes, the emphasis is on applying knowledge independently, investigating issues methodically, and developing operational confidence.

Each lab includes:

• A clearly defined challenge or broken scenario  
• Practical command-line investigation and debugging  
• Step-by-step reasoning behind the solution  
• Key takeaways that strengthen long-term retention  

These labs are designed to simulate production-style environments, helping build troubleshooting instincts and real-world readiness.

➡️ [View Labs](./labs)

### Bandit (Levels 1–12)

The OverTheWire Bandit wargame is used to reinforce **Linux fundamentals** through progressively harder challenges.

Each level documents:
- The challenge goal
- Commands used
- A brief explanation of why the solution works
- A key learning takeaway

Bandit is treated as a **learning exercise**, not a puzzle to brute-force.  
The emphasis is on understanding Linux behaviour rather than memorising solutions.

➡️ [View Bandit solutions](./labs/bandit)

### SadServers (Easy, Medium, Hard)

SadServers scenarios are used to simulate real-world Linux issues commonly encountered in production environments.

Unlike guided challenges, SadServers presents broken systems with minimal context, requiring structured investigation and reasoning.

Notes focus on:
- Observing symptoms and system behaviour
- Forming and testing hypotheses
- Applying fixes deliberately
- Understanding root causes rather than surface-level symptoms

These exercises help develop production-grade troubleshooting and operational thinking.
