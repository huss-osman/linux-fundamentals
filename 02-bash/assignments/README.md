These assignments focus on reinforcing **core Bash scripting fundamentals** through structured, practical challenges.

Each script must:

- Include clear comments explaining what the code does  
- Follow clean, readable structure  
- Use defensive scripting practices  
- Handle edge cases safely  

> [!TIP]  
> Attempt each challenge independently before reviewing solutions.  
> Use `man`, `--help`, and debugging flags like `set -x`.

- Current CPU usage  
- Memory usage (total, used, free)  
- Disk usage  
- Top 5 processes by memory usage  
- Save output to a timestamped log file  

---

## Skills Reinforced

- Input validation
