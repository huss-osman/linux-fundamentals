This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Bash scripting** as part of my **DevOps training with CoderCo**.

Bash is the foundation of Linux automation. Nearly everything in DevOps — containers, CI/CD pipelines, cloud provisioning, and system automation — relies on Bash scripts running at the command line. This repository exists to build and demonstrate that foundation.

The focus throughout this work is on understanding **how Bash behaves and executes**, not memorising syntax.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this module, I aimed to:

- Confidently write and execute Bash scripts
- Understand script execution flow and shell behaviour
- Use variables, parameters, and control structures correctly
- Handle errors and unexpected input safely
- Work with files, processes, and environment variables in scripts
- Apply Bash fundamentals through structured challenges and scripting exercises

---

## Learning Approach

This repository reflects how I learn, not just what I learned.

- Hands-on scripting in real Linux environments
- Writing and breaking scripts to understand failure modes
- Documenting why Bash behaves the way it does
- Revisiting concepts through structured challenges
- Treating confusion and mistakes as part of the learning process

The goal is long-term understanding that transfers directly to production systems.

## Fundamentals

The Fundamentals section focuses on building a strong understanding of **Bash scripting** through hands-on command-line usage and core shell concepts.

Rather than memorising syntax, the emphasis is on learning how **Bash behaves and executes**, and how small mistakes can lead to large failures in automation.

Each topic covers:

- Core Bash concepts and shell behaviour
- Common syntax and how Bash evaluates commands
- Practical examples based on real-world scripting usage
- Key takeaways that reinforce long-term understanding

These notes help build a solid foundation for Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and cloud platforms.

## Labs

The Labs section focuses on reinforcing Bash fundamentals through structured, hands-on scripting challenges.

Rather than following guided notes, the emphasis is on applying knowledge independently, experimenting with scripts, and understanding how Bash behaves in real automation scenarios.

Each lab includes:

• A clearly defined scripting challenge  
• Practical Bash command and scripting usage  
• Step-by-step reasoning behind the solution  
• Key takeaways that strengthen long-term retention  

These labs are designed to simulate real-world scripting problems, helping develop confidence with automation and shell behaviour.

## Assignments

The Assignments section focuses on applying **Bash scripting** concepts through structured, real-world challenges.

Rather than only reinforcing fundamentals, the emphasis is on building practical automation skills, defensive scripting habits, and production-style problem solving.

Each assignment documents:

- The challenge objective  
- Bash concepts being applied  
- Commands and patterns used  
- Implementation details (`.sh` script)  
- A short explanation and key learning takeaway  

Assignments are treated as practical automation exercises, not isolated tasks to complete quickly.  
The emphasis is on writing predictable, readable, and safe scripts that reflect real operational environments.

These challenges help transition from understanding **shell behaviour and execution flow** to building scripts suitable for real **DevOps workflows**.
