# Vim Basics

## Overview
Vim is a powerful text editor commonly used in Linux environments.  
It is especially useful when working on remote servers where graphical editors are unavailable.

## Key Concepts

### Modes
- **Normal mode** – default mode for navigation and commands
- **Insert mode** – used to type text (`i`)
- **Command mode** – used to save, quit, or run commands (`:`)

## Common Commands

- `vim file.txt` – open a file in Vim
- `i` – enter insert mode
- `Esc` – return to normal mode
- `:w` – save file
- `:q` – quit
- `:wq` – save and quit
- `:q!` – quit without saving
- `/word` – search for a word in the file

## Reflection
Learning basic Vim commands made editing files on remote servers much easier and removed the dependency on graphical tools.
