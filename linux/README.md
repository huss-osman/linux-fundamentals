This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Linux** as part of my **DevOps training with CoderCo**.

Linux is the foundation of modern infrastructure. Nearly everything in DevOps — containers, CI/CD, cloud platforms, and automation — assumes a strong understanding of Linux at the command line. This repository exists to build and demonstrate that foundation.

The focus throughout this work is on **understanding how Linux works**, not memorising commands.

---

## Learning Objectives

By working through this module, I aimed to:

- Confidently navigate the Linux file system via the command line
- Manage files, directories, and permissions
- Understand users, groups, and sudo privileges
- Work with processes and system monitoring tools
- Use core Linux utilities (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, pipes, redirection)
- Understand stdin, stdout, and stderr data flow
- Apply fundamentals through structured challenges and troubleshooting

---

## Topics Covered

- Linux terminal basics  
- File system structure and navigation  
- Permissions and ownership  
- Users, groups, and sudo  
- Environment variables  
- Input/output redirection and pipes  
- Bash vs Zsh  
- Vim basics  
- OverTheWire Bandit wargame (Levels 1–20)  
- SadServers real-world Linux troubleshooting exercises  

---

## Learning Approach

This repository reflects **how I learn**, not just what I learned.

- Hands-on practice in real Linux environments (WSL, VMs, cloud instances)
- Solving problems before looking up solutions
- Documenting **why commands work**, not just what they do
- Revisiting concepts through Bandit and SadServers
- Treating confusion and mistakes as part of the learning process

The goal is long-term understanding that transfers to production systems.

## Folder Purpose

**fundamentals/**  
Core Linux concepts explained with examples and reasoning

**bandit/**  
OverTheWire Bandit wargame solutions (Levels 1–20), including commands used and lessons learned

**sadservers/**  
Real-world Linux troubleshooting scenarios and debugging notes

---

## Bandit (Levels 1–20)

The OverTheWire Bandit wargame is used to reinforce Linux fundamentals through progressively harder challenges.

Each level documents:
- The challenge goal
- Commands used
- Brief explanation of why the solution works
- Key learning takeaway

Bandit is treated as a **learning exercise**, not a puzzle to brute-force.

---

## SadServers

SadServers scenarios are used to simulate real-world Linux issues.

Notes focus on:
- Observing symptoms
- Forming hypotheses
- Applying fixes
- Understanding root causes
