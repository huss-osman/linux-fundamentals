```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

## Explanation
The search starts at the root directory (/) to scan the entire system.

The find command filters files by:

• Ownership (-user, -group)

• Exact size (-size 33c)

Permission denied messages are expected and do not affect the result.

## What I Learned
File ownership is a powerful search filter, and permission errors are normal when scanning system directories.
