This folder contains my core Linux fundamentals notes as part of my DevOps training.

Each topic focuses on **understanding how Linux works**, not just memorising commands.

Examples are practical, command-line driven, and tied to real-world usage.

## Learning Focus

- Learn **why** commands work, not just what they do  
- Use Linux the way it’s used in production environments  
- Build a strong foundation for Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud platforms  

These notes are actively updated as I progress through the DevOps curriculum.
