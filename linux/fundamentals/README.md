# Linux Fundamentals

This folder contains my core Linux fundamentals notes as part of my DevOps training.

Each topic focuses on **understanding how Linux works**, not just memorising commands.  
Examples are practical, command-line driven, and tied to real-world usage.

## Topics Covered

- [Terminal Basics](./terminal-basics.md)  
  Navigating the filesystem, basic commands, and working efficiently in the terminal.

- [Shell Basics](./shell-basics.md)  
  Shell concepts, aliases, environment setup, and command execution flow.

- [File System](./file-system.md)  
  Linux directory structure, files vs directories, and filesystem hierarchy.

  Read, write, execute permissions, ownership, chmod, chown, and security concepts.

  User management, groups, sudo, and access control.

## Learning Focus

- Learn **why** commands work, not just what they do  
- Use Linux the way it’s used in production environments  
- Build a strong foundation for Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud platforms  

These notes are actively updated as I progress through the DevOps curriculum.
