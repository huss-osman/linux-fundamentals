# Terminal Basics

## Key Learnings
- The terminal provides direct interaction with the operating system
- Commands follow a consistent structure (command, options, arguments)
- Reading documentation using `man` is essential for understanding commands

## Commands Practised

### `pwd` – Print Working Directory
Displays the full path of the current directory.  
Useful for confirming where you are in the file system.

### `ls` – List Directory Contents
Lists files and directories in the current location.  
Commonly used to explore directory contents before navigating or modifying files.

### `cd` – Change Directory
Moves between directories in the file system.  
Essential for navigation when working from the terminal.

### `man` – Manual Pages
Displays documentation for a given command.  
Helpful for learning command usage, available options, and examples.

## Reflection
Using the terminal felt intimidating at first, but practising these commands made navigation and system interaction much clearer.
