This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Computer Networking** through practical troubleshooting and infrastructure concepts.

Networking is the foundation of modern infrastructure. Nearly everything in DevOps — cloud platforms, containers, APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and distributed systems — relies on strong networking fundamentals.

The focus throughout this work is on understanding **how networking behaves internally**, not memorising definitions.

## 🧠 New to Networking? Read This First

- Networking can feel abstract at first — that’s normal.
- Focus on **how data moves**, not just terminology.
- Use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `nslookup`, and `dig`.
- Draw diagrams to understand traffic flow.
- Revisit concepts multiple times.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don’t understand networking, debugging production systems becomes guesswork.

## Learning Approach

This repository reflects how I learn, not just what I learned.

- Breaking down how data actually flows across systems
- Using real tools instead of only reading theory
- Debugging network issues step by step
- Revisiting concepts until they make sense
- Treating confusion as part of the process

The goal is long-term understanding that transfers directly to **cloud, DevOps, and production environments**.

## Fundamentals

The Fundamentals section focuses on building a strong understanding of networking through **core concepts and real-world behaviour**.

Rather than memorising definitions, the emphasis is on understanding:

• How data moves across networks  
• How protocols interact  
• How systems communicate in real environments  
• Why networking failures happen  

These notes build a foundation for **AWS, Kubernetes, load balancing, DNS, routing, and distributed systems**.

• Real-world networking scenarios  
• Command-line investigation using tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `nslookup`, and `curl`  
• Problem-solving workflows  
• Key takeaways for troubleshooting
