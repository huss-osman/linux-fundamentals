This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Docker** and **containerisation** through practical container workflows.

Docker is a major part of modern infrastructure and application deployment. It allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged into portable environments that run consistently across local systems, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines.

The focus throughout this repository is understanding **how containers, Dockerfiles, images, and networking work** through practical learning.

## 🧠 New to Docker? Read This First

- Docker can feel confusing at first — that’s normal
- Focus on understanding **images, containers, Dockerfiles, and networking**
- Use tools like `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker exec`, and `docker inspect`
- Break containers intentionally to improve debugging skills
- Revisit concepts multiple times through hands-on practice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Understanding Docker is extremely important in modern DevOps, cloud, CI/CD, and application deployment workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this module, I aimed to:

- Understand what containers are and why they matter
- Learn the difference between images and containers
- Understand Docker Engine and Docker Desktop
- Build Docker images using Dockerfiles
- Run and manage containers locally
- Understand container isolation and portability
- Learn core Docker troubleshooting commands
- Build a strong foundation for future Docker networking and orchestration topics

## Learning Approach

This repository reflects how I learn, not just what I learned.

- Building and breaking containers to understand behaviour
- Using real Docker commands instead of only reading theory
- Understanding how Docker actually works internally
- Practicing troubleshooting and debugging
- Building a strong foundation before moving into orchestration and production tooling

The goal is long-term understanding that transfers directly into **cloud infrastructure**, **CI/CD**, and modern **DevOps environments**.

## Folder Purpose

### `fundamentals/`

Core Docker and containerisation concepts explained using practical examples and hands-on commands.

➡️ [Open fundamentals](./fundamentals)

---

### `labs/`

Hands-on Docker debugging and troubleshooting exercises.

➡️ [Open labs](./labs)

---

## Fundamentals

The Fundamentals section focuses on building a strong understanding of Docker through **core container concepts and real-world behaviour**.

Rather than memorising commands, the emphasis is on understanding:

• How containers are created and executed  
• How Docker images work  
• How Docker Engine manages containers  
• Why portability and consistency matter  
• How Docker supports modern DevOps workflows  

These notes build a strong foundation for future topics such as **Docker Compose**, **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, and **cloud deployments**.

➡️ [View Fundamentals](./fundamentals)

---

## Labs

The Labs section focuses on applying Docker knowledge through **hands-on debugging and investigation**.

Each lab includes:

• Real-world container errors  
• Command-line investigation using Docker tools  
• Troubleshooting service communication and networking  
• Key takeaways for container debugging  

These labs simulate the kind of issues faced in **development and production environments**.

## Hands-On Docker Repository

Alongside these fundamentals notes, I also maintain a hands-on Docker repository focused on practical containerisation workflows and real-world experimentation.

The repository includes Docker commands, image creation, container management, troubleshooting, and step-by-step learning progression.
